# CrowNest-YVR_Hackthon
Task is to develop a solution that builds off the Crow's Nest concept, utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as intelligent sensors, computer vision, and machine learning to monitor, detect, and report real-time insights into the condition of public spaces. Identify areas requiring attention from cleaning staff due to high traffic volume or observed waste and clutter. Detect unattended baggage, left belongings such as chargers, clothing, and anything else that may come to mind. Some poor facility standard example images included in this presentation.
Bonus points will be awarded for solutions that can log passenger volume over time with separate classifications for types of use.

## Expectations
Design and implement an evolved version of the Crows Nest solution that integrates intelligent sensors, computer vision, and machine learning.
* Enhance the capabilities of the Crows Nest system to accurately monitor and detect cleanliness issues, waste, and clutter in public spaces.
* Develop advanced algorithms to classify and prioritize detected issues based on severity and urgency.
* Automate the reporting process to operations center staff, ensuring quick and easy interpretation of reported issues.
* Maintain the core principles of Crows Nest, such as real-time monitoring and optimization of cleaning processes, while introducing new features and improvements.
* Camera locations will be set with 1 on the roof, and 2 on orthogonal walls facing towards the testing area in the optimal orientation for testing. The 3 cameras have different focal lengths with a variety of capture distances and lens view angles including 131° and 56°.
